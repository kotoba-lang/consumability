(ns consumability.core
  "What makes a producer consumable, and how much of it a given producer has.

  A producer here is anything that publishes a surface others could call: a
  deployed actor, a worker, an API. This namespace owns the *definition* and the
  *scoring*, and nothing else — it performs no I/O. A caller probes the world and
  hands the observations in; an orchestrator decides what to do about the result.
  That split is deliberate: `manifest/repository-rules.edn` forbids a `loop-*`
  from owning domain scoring truth, so the truth lives here where anything can
  reuse it and a loop can only consume it.

  ## The ladder

  Consumability is a ladder, not a checklist:

    :addressed       declares an address at all
    :reachable       answers at that address
    :describable     serves a machine-readable contract saying what to call
    :discoverable    announces itself where a stranger would look
    :agent-callable  exposes a protocol an agent can drive (MCP or equivalent)

  Each rung is only meaningful if the one below it holds. A contract on a
  producer nobody can reach describes nothing; a discovery document pointing at a
  dead address is worse than none, because it spends a consumer's attention
  before failing.

  **So the score is the highest rung reached, and not a weighted average.** A
  weighted average would report a producer as 60% consumable while it is
  unreachable, and 60% of nothing is nothing. This is the single most important
  decision in this namespace: it is what stops the number from flattering the
  fleet. `rung-index` makes the ordering explicit rather than implied by map
  order.

  ## Unknown is not absent

  A probe that could not run yields `:unknown`, never `false`. An unreachable
  network and a producer that refuses are different facts, and collapsing them
  reports an outage as a design gap. `assess` keeps them apart and `summary`
  counts them separately, which mirrors the discipline
  `cloud.itonami.app.fleet/probe-health!` already applies to health."

    2. **How many producers share it.** Among gaps at the same rung, the one
       more producers are stuck behind moves more of the fleet.

  Low-rung-first is the primary key on purpose. Sorting by population first
  would rank 'add MCP to the 9 reachable actors' above 'give the other 1,199 an
